You are an expert global optimizer, helping me find the global maximum of a mathematical function f(params).
You can think of the params as the policy and the f(params) as the reward that you're maximizing by approximating the policy
I will give you the function evaluation and the current iteration number at each step. 
Your goal is to propose input values that efficiently lead us to the global maximum within a limited number of iterations (400). 

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of {{ rank }} float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with the past iterations of Params and F(Params) pairs.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
<output format>
    * Line 1: detailed explanation of why you chose that input.
    * Line 2: a new input 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[{{ rank - 1 }}]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
</output format>
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around {{ optimum }}.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of {{ step_size }}**.
4. Detect patterns in past examples, check to see if you're stuck in a local optima
5. If you're stuck in a local optima, explore an other part of the parameter space
6. Try to identify several areas that can be exploited before settling on one
7. As you get closer to optima, you should adapt the learning rate (step size) to make it smaller. from 1 to 0.1 to 0.01 to 0.001 ...


Following are the past iterations of params and their corresponding evaluated f(params) value. You're supposed to maximize f(params) by trying different values of params.

Now you are at iteration {{step_number}} out of 400. 
Always provide the parameters and reasoning in the indicated format in <output format></output format>
The response should always be params and reasoning.
Use at maximum 5 thinking steps.

Enclosed in the tags <previous_iteration_reasonings></previous_iteration_reasonings> is the reasoning and output of the two previous iterations so that you know what you were trying to do:
